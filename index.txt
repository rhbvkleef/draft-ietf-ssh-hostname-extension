Abstract

   This document describes an extension for SSH that allows an SSH
   server to identify which virtual host a client is attempting to
   connect to.  It ensures that unextended clients can interoperate with
   extended servers and vice-versa, albeit without the features provided
   as a result of this document.

1.  Introduction

   Many application-layer protocols already have means of specifying
   which "virtual host" a client intends to connects to.  Examples are
   the HTTP 'Host' header as specified by the IANA Message Headers
   [IANA_MH] list, and the FTP HOST command [RFC7151].  Most of these
   implementations note that it is used to identify different virtual
   hosts where multiple DNS names resolve to one IP address.  The goal
   of this document is to make it possible to implement similar features
   to SSH by enhancing the 'username' field in the user authentication
   packet so that it can be used to specify to which virtual host the
   client means to connect.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Throughout this document, when the fields are referenced, they will
   appear within single quotes.  When values to fill those fields are
   referenced, they will appear within double quotes.  Using the above
   example, possible values for 'data' are "foo" and "bar".

   The required syntax is defined using the Augmented BNF defined in
   [RFC5243].  Some general ABNF definitions are required throughout the
   document; they will be defined in subsequent sections.

   With the increased use of virtualization technologies, there may be
   several possible definitions for the term "virtual host".  This
   document follows the definition from Section 4.1.14 of [RFC3875],
   where several virtual hosts share the same IP address, and hostnames
   are used by the server-SSH process to route sessions to the
   appropriate virtual host.

3.  Updates for the Protocol Version Exchange

   SSH has a method of exchanging details about the protocol version and
   supported featureset.  This is described in section 4.2 of [RFC4253].
   Both the server and the client MUST add a 'comments' entry containing
   the string "x-virtualhost" in the version string as specified in the
   aforementioned section of the aforementioned RFC.  The client or
   server respectively, can then use the presence or absence of the
   value "x-virtualhost" in the list of 'comments' to determine whether
   the server or client, respectively, supports the protocol extension
   described in this document.

4.  Updates for SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST

   This document proposes the name of the virtual host be placed in the
   'username' field of the "SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST" message next to
   the actual username.

4.1.  Syntax of the 'username' Field

   The method of embedding the name of the virtual host in the
   'username' field of the aforementioned packet is separating the
   username and the name of the virtual host by an "@"-sign.  The name
   of the virtual host MUST be a valid hostname as specified by section
   3.2.2 of [RFC3986].

   It should still be possible to simply specify a username without a
   specification of a virtual host.  If this is wanted, an "@"-sign MUST
   be appended to the username, unless the username does not contain an
   "@"-sign, in which case, an "@"-sign SHOULD NOT be appended to the
   username.

   Formalizing the preceding text, the value of the 'username' field of
   the "SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST" will conform to this grammar:

      username_value    =  username "@" virtual_host_name
      username_value    =/ username "@"
      username_value    =/ username_noat

      username          =  1*(%x01-%x10FFFF)
      username_noat     =  1*(%x01-%x39 / %x41-%x10FFFF)
      virtual_host_name =  <See section 3.2.2 of RFC3986>

5.  Interoperability

   It is essential that older implementations of SSH servers and clients
   will keep working, even when the other party does support the
   protocol alterations as described in this document.  It is acceptable
   to fall back to the behaviour and featureset of the SSH protocol
   without the features and behaviours resulting from the extension
   described in this document.

   When a new client is used to connect to a server that does not
   support the extension described in this document, the client MUST NOT
   submit a name of the virtual host and MUST NOT append the username
   with an "@"-sign.  Any services that depend on the specification of a
   virtual host can be expected to be absent or dysfunctional, and
   should not be requested.

   When the server detects a client that does not support the extension
   described in this document, the server MUST interpret the username
   field as if it is a username in its entirity, without attempting to
   split out a hostname.  The server should then proceed as if no
   virtual host was specified by the client.

6.  Security considerations

   All the credentials are submitted over a secure line.  That means
   that the name of the virtual host is submitted over a secure
   transport as well.  The extension information is not submitted over a
   secure line.  It is, in fact, submitted over plaintext.  That means
   that a potential attacker could override advertised support, or lack
   thereof, of the extension described in this document.  This does not
   introduce a critical security issue, as overriding this will very
   likely cause a failed authentication, either because the requested
   user does not exist on the server, or because the credentials used
   are not valid for the requested user.
